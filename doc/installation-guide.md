# Installation guide [Draft]

Next to the Virtual Folder on public west-life portal at https://portal.west-life.eu/virtualfolder you can install Virtual Folder as an virtual machine instance. 

There are 3 options
  * Cloud installation - to install in OpenNebula, OpenStack or any other cloud computing provider.
  * Local installation - using Virtual Box on local workstation or cluster for testing purposes or for private deployment.
  * Development installation - same as "Local installation", but contains source code of Virtual Folder.
