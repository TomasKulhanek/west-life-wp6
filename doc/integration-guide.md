The public west-life portal is hosted at [https://portal.west-life.eu](https://portal.west-life.eu). You can also add it into your web site. There are 2 main strategies for doing this:

* link/popup of west-life web page, see filepicker demo. The filepicker.html is hosted by your web site. The filepickercomponent.html is hosted by west-life. Continue with [Link component](integration-guide/link-component.md)
* embedding west-life component - the web page is hosted by your web site.  It links to some functionality hosted by west-life which is projected to the web page. Continue with [Embedding component](integration-guide/embedding-component-into-web-site.md)
