PDB visualization. The PDB files within the connected storage can be visualized. The embedded NGL browser (https://github.com/arose/ngl) is used. The following buttons will load the appropriate PDB file into the viewer. 
If there are present PDB files within the connected storage and "mydata" subdirectory - a button is generated for it.
